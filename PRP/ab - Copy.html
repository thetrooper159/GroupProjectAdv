</div>
<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;font-style:none;text-align:center;">You may have heard of our team from appraised projects like the world's first computer, the discovery of quantum physics, and helping with the midterm website. When brainstorimg ideas for the final project, the thought that came to our minds were: "We need to create an application so useful in today's economy that not only would using it help the user, but would help the world as a whole." With that driving thought in mind, we came up with The Shopping List (no copyrights/trademarks)! Not only would using this application help the user create a list of goods needed in their shopping experience, but it could give the user suggestions of what to buy and even refer an application that removes the entire process of grocery shopping! We hope the public will be as estatic about this project as we are!</p>
